# number-theory

Code written to answer questions arising while reading the
books

* Elements of Number Theory, Ireland and Rosen
* Number Fields, Marcus
* Lectures on Modular Forms, Gunning

I'm sure that most of the number theory calculations proper
are already done better in serious languages/packages such
as pari and Sage.  But much of the motivation was to learn
through building the necessary tools.
